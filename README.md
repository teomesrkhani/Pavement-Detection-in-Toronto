# Pavement Detection in Toronto (In Progress...)

### Motivation
According to The CAA (Canadian Automotive Association) poor roads in Canada cost drivers an additional $3 billion every year (source: https://www.caa.ca/app/uploads/2021/03/Poor-Roads-Final_20210330.pdf). Additionally, it may be uncomfortable and inconvenient to drive on bumpy roads.
